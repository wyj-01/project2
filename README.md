## CNN
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a volutional Neural Network. And Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a special multi-layer feedforward Neural Network, which is inspired by the biological natural visual cognitive mechanism (animal visual cortex cells are responsible for detecting optical signals). Its artificial neurons can respond to a fraction of the surrounding units in the area of coverage, and are excellent for large image processing.



## Dateset
MNIST is an open source dataset which is used for handwritten digits recognition. It contains 55000 samples for training, 5000 samples for validation and 10000 samples for test. Each of sample is a 28x28 grayscale image and the content is 0 to 9 digit.



## Tensorflow
In this test we use tensorflow, and we change the size of the convolution kernel to do 3 times.</br>The size of convolution kernel are respectively 5x5, 9x9, 3x3.</br>And finally the test Accuracy is 0.990, 0.988, 0.987.



## Keras
Then we use keras to implement the function of LeNet-5.We alse changing the size of the convolution kernel to  carry out two tests.The reasons are as follow.

## test summary
Through two tests, we found that the validation accuracy of convolutional neural network implemented by tensorflow was higher than that of Keras.


# Course Summary
This machine learning course is my first contact with python and many algorithms, and I learned to use GitHub and solve simple code errors. I will continue to learn relevant knowledge in the future to deepen my understanding of machine learning.
Thanks to Peter for teaching!
